		<p>Google Summer of Code is a two - and a half - month coding program where students all around the world help develop softwares for different open-source organizations. This summer I had the opportunity to work for the organization <a href = "#"><p3>Gemstash</p3></a>, which is an organization under the Ruby programming language and an application for RubyGems.org. Gemstash is a renowed gem that serves as a private cache and gem server for gems from <a href= "#"><p3>RubyGems.org</p3></a>. For Summer of Code, I proposed to implement an Amazon S3 cloud storage implementation for gemstash, as well as developing an abstract backend module that would improve the ability to add future backend storage systems. The details of my proposal can be found on the <a href = "#"><p3> Google Summer of Code </p3></a>website.</p>
